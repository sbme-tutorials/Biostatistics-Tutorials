# SBE2240 Biostatistics Final Project

## Objective

Statistics plays an essential role in analyzing the data and making a decision based on it.  In this project, you will explore different types of statistical techniques and learn how to use them to build and deploy a statistical-based Machine learning system. 

## Main Project Idea 

The main idea of the project is to select a specific dataset and use one of the supervised learning methods to build a system that's capable of predicting the class of a new data item. You're also required to deploy it using a simple web application so the end-users can use it. 


The main steps of the project: 

1. Data preprocessing and exploration 
2. Feature extraction and selection 
3. Training the ML model 
4. Testing the model 
5. Deploying the model on a web application 

## Suggested datasets

1. Cardiovascular disease detection
    
    Classify the patients to be healthy or suffering from cardiovascular disease based on the given attributes [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10ncKH-338bcZpLnRlWnNqjy9x5K4oSCe)

2. Predict diabetes

    Build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not? [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TyRe_rpc4Jyvf8ks3znknmaEmLcqoqsw?usp=sharing)

3. Coronavirus tweets Text Classification
    
    Classify the tweets about the Coronavirus into positive, neutral, or negative tweets. [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n6z0IwMjHAaFQgVQAVzPm4XU1VjEmAjc)
    
4. Covid Patients' Chest X-Ray images 
 
    Differentiate between covid patient lungs and normal ones.[link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IZRX1ADKuE3hcUjTXAFHOgSoWVo54tU9)


## Other Datasets

You can select any other dataset and it isn't necessary to be a medical dataset but you should inform the TA and get his confirmation. 


## Allowed Classifiers

1. Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier 
2. Supported Vector Machine Classifier (SVM)
3. Decision Tree Classifier  
4. Random Forest 
5. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
6. KNearest Neighbors Classifier (KNN)

## General Rules 

* Each team should use only one dataset and one classifier so the combination of (the data, and classifier) is unique per team. 
* The team members should be 4 at maximum. 
* For those who will select the third or fourth suggested dataset, the team members are allowed to be 5

## Project Deliverables

* A Github repo of the Python implementation of the system 

* Presentation includes
    * Scientific background of the used classifier
    * Explanation of the dataset 
    * The classification results
    * Demo for system deployment. 

## Grading Criteria

* 60% on building the ML system
* 20% on Deploying the system on a web application.
* 10% on follow-up meeting with the TA
* 10% on the presentation
